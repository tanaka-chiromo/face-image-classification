# face-image-classification
An implementation of python and tensorflow of a facial recognition system using the AT&T Laboratories Cambridge 'Database of Faces'.

Facial images Classification
============================

An implementation of a convolutional neural network image classification 
algorithm. 40 peopleâ€™s faces are used to train and test this classifier. 
The best test accuracy achieved so far as been 96.25% when the data is shared 
80% training and 20% testing. Ratio can be changed on first line of code.


Instructions
============
The 'Database of Faces' from the AT&T Laboratories Cambridge was
used in this implementation.

Download the dataset from; 

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBP5pZmuVgUXO3JuFFDtu293xH2OtiNL

After downloading save the directory named 'faces', containing the 40 classes, 
into the same directory containing the script "facial_recognition.py" .

To start the execution, run the script .... facial_recognition.py


Dependencies
============

Implemented using python3 and tensorflow with dependencies;

>> tensorflow

>> pandas

>> numpy

>> cv2


Training
========

8 out of 10 images of each of the different 40 classes were used for training and validation. 2 out of 10 of each of the faces were used for testing.

Loss function: cross entropy
Optimising algorithm: momentum optimizer (learning rate = 0.001, momentum = 0.9)
Total number of epochs: 150



Results
=======

The model achieved a training accuracy of
